# TextureQuilting
Stitch together image patches sampled from an input texture to synthesize new texture images
1. Shortest vertical path from top to bottom through a matrix using dynamic programming and backtracking
2. Stitch two images with an overlap zone along the seam with similar brightness values
3. Repeat that stitching process for the requested image size to quilt an image together that now looks seamless
